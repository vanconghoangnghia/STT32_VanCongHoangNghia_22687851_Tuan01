  <p> <span style="color: rgb(136, 72, 36);">Thanks to everyone who made Fiddler on the Roof Jr. 
    such a smashing success!</span> After all of the hard work 
    on rehearsals and set building and promotion, 
    it really paid off. I have gotten so many comments
    on your wonderful performances. <br> <br>
    I've started putting up a <a href="Slide1.html">slide show</a> of the 
    production. Please feel free to download the files 
    from the Web site. If you want high resolution 
    photos on a photo CD, please contact me. <br> <br>
    Once again: <span style="color: rgb(136, 72, 36);"><i>BRAVO!!!</i></span> -- Mrs. Juroszek</p>
